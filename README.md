To run your app using the npm run dev command, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
4. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will execute the script defined in the "dev" field of the "scripts" section in your package.json file.

5. The "dev" script typically starts a development server, compiles your code, and watches for changes. The specific behavior may vary depending on how the script is configured.

6. Once the script has successfully executed, you should see output in the terminal indicating that your app is running or the development server has started.

Note: If you are running this command for the first time, make sure to run `npm install` before running `npm run dev`. This command will install all the dependencies required by your app based on the information provided in your package.json file.
